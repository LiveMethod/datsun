## Finding parts

Note: These diagrams don't make distinctions between 240 and 280 as often as they should. For example, there is only one "rear suspension" diagram, and it does not appear to make a distinction between 240 and 280 spacers, which are different heights. Double check before buying parts based on this tool alone.
