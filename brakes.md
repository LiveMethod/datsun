## Toyota brake upgrade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98QlRQUYrxY
This video includes:
  * 280
  * Front brakes only
  * 250 shipped before core rebate
  * 89 Toyota 4runner 3L v6 brakes, 
  * 85 Nissan 300zx 3.0L Vt NA (important!) rotors
  * Wagner pads
  * T3 Spacer plate (includes new bolts)
  * This setup is optional. There is a 79 toyota variant that keeps the stock Z rotor.
  * Requires trimming back the dust shield (trivial)
  * Consider repacking or replacing wheel bearings
  * Stock brake lines can be used, might take some bending (I think i want to replace)
  * Recommended to get a 280zx brake booster. It's said that it can be skipped, which will result in longer pedal travel. That.... sounds like something I might actually prefer, depending on just how much longer it is.

This video includes:
  * Silvermine motors rear brake wilwood kit
  * Rotor, adapter plate, wilwood calipers, pads, and the last-mile flexible brake line.
  * ARP wheel studs (longer)
  * Brake booster delete (via new wilwood master cylinder)
  * OEM drum brakes have already been cut off (not shown)
  * Removing old studs
  * A neat trick with washers for deeply seating new studs  
  * Adapter plate placement
  * Grinding stud plate edges slightly to accomodate new rotors
  * Installing pads in calipers
  * Brake fluid entry nozzle install on caliper
  * Front kit – stage 4 non-wilwood big brake kit
  * Disc, caliper, pads, and spacer plate.
  * Two types of pads in this kit, one has a lip and one doesn't. It matters where they're installed. The video is not specific about the correct configuration.
  * Opening the front wheel bearing
  * Removing wheel bearing coiter nut
  * Removing rotor from... whatever the knuckle thing is called
  * Inserting new studs
  * Attaching new rotor
  * Spinning the rotor while reattaching the wheel bearing parts
  * He doesn't repack the bearing because the bearings were rebuilt and had no miles on them. This will not be true for me.
