# Suspension

## General

"TC Rods" are a common topic in Z suspension. Note that "Tension Rods", "Compression Rods", "Tension Control Rods", and "Tension Compression Rods" reference the same object.

[This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Datsun/comments/821tom/280z_lowering_springs_vs_coilovers/) has a lot of great info covering
* Choosing between coilovers and springs
* Wheel size, tire size, spring rates
* The impact of tire sizes on handling
	* Wider fronts = more effort to turn w/o power steering
* The effects of staggered wheels with more rear contact
	* More contact = more grip
	* More mass = costs more power to move
	* More understeer
* Roll center adjusters/bump steer spacers
* Camber plates

* [Corner balancing](https://www.elephantracing.com/tech-topics/corner-balance/)
	* Pro: Distributes weight evenly across wheels, so the weight moves predictably between left and right turns.
	* Con: Fender gap may be different on each corner

* Additional suggestions at time of coilover install
	* Roll Center Adjusters / Bump Steer Spacers
	* Adjustable control arms
	* Replace strut isolator bearing

## Bushings

Here's the list of things in a suspension bushings kit from zcarsource.

Two big notes here, both very important.

1) Tension control rods require OEM rubber or a material of similar flexibility.

**DO NOT USE URETHANE BUSHINGS ON TENSION CONTROL RODS OR _YOU WILL FUCKING DIE_**.

Urethane's stiffness is desirable in race suspension but its failure to compress prevents natural, necessary rotation that would be present in a softer rubber bushing. Inability to move naturally transfers stresses to the control rod in a way that can lead it to snap. If this happens in a turn at speed you're gonna have a bad time.

Avoid this by using OEM rubber when replacing this bushing, or by switching to a bushingless tension control rod. As a bonus, aftermarket rods can also enable caster adjustement.

2) Note the inclusion of replacement spindle pins and corresponding hardware. Spindle pin removal is a rite of pssage on a datsun and they are highly unlikely to survive the ordeal. For more information see "Spindle Pins" on this page.

Replacement kit should roughly include:

* 2 front coltrol arm bushings
* 2 front sway bar mount bushings
* 16 sway bar end link bushings
* 4 tension rod bushings
* 2 rear control arm bushings (forward)
* 2 rear control arm bushings (rear)
* 2 rear sway bar mount bushings
* 4 spindle pin bushings
* 2 spindle pins
* 4 spindle pin nuts
* 4 spindle pin rubber washers
* 1 aftermarket urethane mustache bar bushing set

A note about lower control arm bushings: 

> Also remember that the urethane inner lower control arm bushing needs a tightening process different then what's in the FSM. The OEM bushing relies on the hysteresis of the rubber for movement while the urethane busing rotates around the inner metal bushing. Tightening the 14mm bolt to the factory spec can seriously bind the bushing in place. I've had customer cars come in where the bushing is so bound I could almost do a pullup in the control arm before it moved. Before putting the strut back on the arm, tighten the control arm bolt to the factory spec and make sure the arm moves easily. If it doesn't, back off on the bolt torque. I also suggest using new Nylock nuts every time.

## Tension Control Rods

### Rod Sockets
These replace the outward facing TC rod bushing with a ball and socket, which allows for superior rotation. They come well recommended as the next best thing if you're not going to spend on custom arms, by Z veterans, in the same thread where they say poly bushings will crack rods, which has me feeling pretty good.

## Roll Center Adjusters / Bump Steer Spacers
I don't know much about these. Lowering the vehicle changes the suspension geometry of the control arms (among other things) in a way that can negatively impact bump steer. This can be compensated for with roll center adjusters.

More homework/information needed here.

## Strut Insulators
[Example](http://atlanticz.ca/zclub/techtips/suspension/strutbumperlowering/index.htm)

Out of the factory, the back of the 280 sits higher than the front in a way some people find undesirable.

If you want to lower the car while maintining the stock suspension, one solution is to use rear strut insulators from the 240, which are shorter, to counteract this. Because the isolators are above the springs, they are sprung weight and size modifications do not impact suspension geometry.

Additionally, it appears that 280 front isolators can be used in the back as well. These front isolators have bearings for turning required by the front wheels, which are not required in the rear, but having an unused bearing is inconsequential in this application.

**WARNING: CONFIRM DIMENSIONS**

I have personally confirmed that the front and rear bolt patterns are identical.

I have not confirmed whether the strut widths are consequential or if bolt pattern is the only thing that needs to match. 240s run narrower struts by a few mils. If there's a mismatch, can the hole be safely widened?

## Spindle Pins
These tend to get destroyed on removal. Expect that they will not be salvageable.

### Workarounds

[This thread](https://forums.hybridz.org/topic/116959-58th-bolt-option-for-spindle-pin-replacement/) on replacing the spindle pin with a bolt. 

> I've ran this on a number of race cars.  They get a lot of maintenance but never seen a problem.  For a street car the stock spindle pin is safer but if you use the lock I think you'd get most of the safety. 

> You can get a new Nissan pin for $22.23.  $12 to get you going in a pinch ï»¿is one thing, but there's no improvement here.  It's not an "upgrade" it's just different.
