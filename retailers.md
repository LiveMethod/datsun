Where to buy things!

Buy parts in groups where you can. Research store inventory in advance and try to get as many items as you can on one shipping charge.

Do the shipping math. A part that's $5 more expensive from a retailer you need other things from can end up cheaper than buying a less expensive part with its own shipping cost.
